## Dead end section

This section can never be reached.

It contains some indented text which is not formatted in any way like this:


   Some text
   spread over several lines
   where line breaks are kept
   and formatting like *bold* or
   ~italic~ is not done.
   
Now the same text but unindented:

Some text
spread over several lines
where line breaks are kept
and formatting like *bold* or
~italic~ is not done.
